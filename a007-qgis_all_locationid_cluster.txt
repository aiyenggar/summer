In QGIS - Create a Layer from a Delimited Text File, 
Layer - Add Layer - Create a layer from a delimited text file
/Users/aiyenggar/OneDrive/PatentsView/location.tsv Let the X: Longitude and Y: Latitude be as default. Set CRS to WGS84 EPSG:4326 (was previously World Geodetic System 1984 IGNF:WBS84G)

Open merged_usmsa_worldurban.shp file

Vector -> Data Management Tools -> Join Attributes by Location
I have changed the order this time, as I didnâ€™t get the whole list last time
Target vector layer (Location)
Join vector layer (merged_usmsa_worldurban)
Geometric Predicate (intersects)
Joined table - Keep all records (including non-matching target records)

This will take a few hours, then say yes to if you would like to add the layer to TOC. Choose the CRS as above. I save this as regions_usmsa_worldurban_100k

Open the attribute table, select all. Now go back to the map, right click on the layer and save as -> use csv option and save as /Users/aiyenggar/OneDrive/code/PatentsView/locationid_region.csv

{8-Dec-2016 - Not sure if I need this anymore:
Add an additional line at the end: missing_location_id,DataUnavailable and}
